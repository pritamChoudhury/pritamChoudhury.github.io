      I am Pritam Choudhury. I am very excited to start a new phase of my academic career at IIT Kanpur. I have joined the CSE Department as an Assistant Professor. If you are a student here, come say hi!

      My primary research interest is in type systems and programming language design (<a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zA97fLIAAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar Profile</a>). My research focuses on graded type systems and their applications. In my doctoral dissertation, I used graded type systems to analyze linearity and dependency in programming languages. Linearity and dependency analyses are particularly useful in memory management, language-based security, multi-stage compilation and code optimization. I completed my PhD at the University of Pennsylvania in the summer of 2023. After graduation, I taught as a Visiting Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Haverford College during the academic year 2023-24.

    Before starting my PhD, I worked as an MPhil student in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Cambridge. My research there focussed on the <a href = "https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~amp12/agda/choudhury/choudhury-dissertation.pdf">constructive formalization of nominal sets in Agda</a>. Before I got interested in Computer Science, I studied Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee. My final year project was in <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx9UyZRM4BJoeFJtbUl5cy1pSGM/view?usp=drivesdk&resourcekey=0-nyu82HNCM8MGMAeD40_CuQ">detection of bad data and false data in power systems</a>.

    Other than academics, I like hiking, poetry and martial arts. I consider myself lucky to be a part of the <a href="https://upenntkd.org/">Penn TaeKwonDo Club</a>.
