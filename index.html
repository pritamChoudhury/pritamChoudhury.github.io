    I am Pritam Choudhury. I am finishing my doctoral studies in Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania. Currently, I am working in the intersection of security and programming language theory.

    Before starting my PhD, I worked as an MPhil student in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Cambridge. My research there focussed on the constructive formalization of nominal sets in Agda.

    Before I got interested in Computer Science, I studied Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee. My final year project was in <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx9UyZRM4BJoeFJtbUl5cy1pSGM/view?usp=drivesdk&resourcekey=0-nyu82HNCM8MGMAeD40_CuQ">detection of bad data and false data in power systems</a>.

    Other than academics, I like hiking, poetry and martial arts. I consider myself lucky to be a part of the <a href="https://upenntkd.org/">Penn TaeKwonDo Club</a>.

    I am looking for research positions starting early 2023. If you are interested in my research or want to know more about my work, please feel free to contact me.
